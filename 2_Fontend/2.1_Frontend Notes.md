HTTP
=============

### What happend when accessing a web address?

+ client side:
  1. Browser get URL
  1. Browser check cache to see if the request resources already exist
  1. DNS look up and get IP address

+ client to server:
  1. Wrip http request
  1. Build connection with server using IP address (tcp/IP)
  1. Send http request
        4. Get response
        5. Close the connection

+ sercer back to client:
  1. Browser receive response
  1. Check the response to see whether the response is not valid or return error
  1. Parse the response for display (HTML content and CSS Js rendering)

### What is www
World Wide Web is a network of infomation resources.
- Naming schema for location of resources -> URL
- Protocol for access to resources -> HTTP
- HyperText for easy scan or navigation resources -> HTML

### What is http?
Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is an ***stateless*** **application** protocol, the fundation of data communication for WWW. (stateless for example, send two same request, server won't response it just served the object, it will resend the previous response again) - 不保存用户的信息，发送不带状态，每次请求都要重发

Hypertext is structure text used between nodes containing text, HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext 

- Request message:
        Request line (method field, URL, HTTP version);
        Request header fields;
        Empty line;
        Optional message body;
- Response message:
        Status line include protocol version, status code and reason message;
        Response header field;
        Empty line;
        Optional message body;
### What is https?
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is a communication protocol for secure communication.

It consist of communication over HTTP with a connection encrypted by **Transport layer security or Secure Socket Layer**
    
Basically, it's about authentication of visited web site and protection of privacy and integrity of exchange data

### Differences between http and https?
When communicating using HTTPS, the client and server need to generate a session key while building connection as authentication code.

Then both side will encrypted the meesage using the key so that no one in between can read it. 

### Status code 
Used in response message status line

1XX means receive request still processing

2XX means Action successfully received, understood and accepted
        
        200 request receive and return response

3XX means Request need send to another server need further action

        301 move permanently, response new URL

------
4XX means Client Error request have syntax error or can't fulfilled

        400 bad request, don't understood request
        404 not found, request documnet doest not exist

5XX means Server Error Server failed to fulfill valid request

        505 HTTP version not supported

### **Port** for http and https?
Port number is a 16 bit number, used to associate with IP address to complete the destination address

HTTP 80
HTTPs 443

### Socket?
Socket is nothing but a combination of IP and port. <font color = #DC143C>PORT + IP </font>

### Persistent and Non-Persistent
how many request/response pair during one TCP connection 

HTML PART
=============
### HTML
HyperText Markup Language, all computer my understand. To publish information

### HTML 5
2012 support responsive application
<!doctype html>
```html
<html>
  <head>
     <title></title>
     <Style>
     <Link>
     <Meta> desctiption anthor
     <Script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

### TAG & attribute
Tag is reference in HTML which describe the style and structure of document.
```html
        <h1> biggest
        <p>
        <hr size= width= align= color=> 上加横线
        <div align="" > container arrange where we want to display the block

        _top	Load in the full body of the window
        <image src="">
        <center>
        <strike> = <del>
        <sup>上标
        <sub>下标
        <table width= border= align= background= cellspacing="space between cell" cellpadding="space between cell border and contents">
                <tr>
                        <th colspan= rowspan= align= valign= >header</th>

        <textarea>
```
### special character and symbols 
        &gt >
        &lt <
        &nbsp nonbreak spaces
### Inline element and Bolck element
- Block element
        * Always start on a new line
        * Takes up full width available
- Inline element
        * Not start with new line
        * Takes up the width as necessary
### Button and Submit difference
submit
* add for form, submit info to address at action

button
* used anywhere, can used to redirect to any link and not restricted to form action

CSS
=============
### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets, how to display
* sparate structure from presentation
* advance control of presentation
* easy maintance
* fast loading

### Attaching
* inline <p style = > perference
* internal < style > in < head >
* external < link type ="text/css"  href = "">
* imported CSS < head > <@IMPORT url("") < /head >

### Selector
1. type selector, tag element h1{} p{}
2. class selector, .name {}
3. id selector, #id {}
4. universal selector, * {} all element
5. descendent selector, div p{} <div> <p> 中间可以有其他tag
6. child selector, div > p 必须相邻
7. attribute selector span[lang] {} span[lang = "zh"]{} [attr~=space separated |= *=contains ^=prefix]
8. group selector, group same selector h1, h2, h3

### PROPERTY
* color
* background-color -image **-repeat**:repeat-x no-repeat -attachment:fixed(保持在窗口的同一位置)/scroll
* font -family -style -variant -weight -size -stretch
* text -indent(起始空格) -align word-spacing letter-spacing(单个char 和word之间的space)
* table -border-collapse
* border style
* margin: up right bottom left
* padding

### Difference between **margin** and **padding**?
Padding is space between the border and element content. It's inside the element

Margin is space between elements. It's outside the elements. (top and bottom margins are collapsible)

### CSS link
        a:link - unvisited hyperlink
        a:visited - visited link
        a:hover - mouse hovering on it
        a:active - click time

### visibility
        hidden
        visible
        collapse
### CSS overflow (of the textarea)
        box content larger than box
        {
                visible: over the border (default)
                hidden: not showing
                scroll: box size not change, apply scroll
                auto: The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when necessary 
        }

### CSS positioning (of the block)
* static - is not positioned in any special way
* absolute - is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
* relative - is positioned relative to its normal position/ element next to
* fixed -  is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
* sticky - based on scroll position

### pseudo
放置鼠标
### @rules
        @import css file
        @charset character set the style sheet uses
        !important
